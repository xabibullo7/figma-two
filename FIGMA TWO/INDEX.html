    <p>Your happiness (and ability to focus) are impacted by the amount of stress you experience. In the same way,<br>
         negative feelings can contribute to physical and chemical stress in the body and brain.</p>
         <br>
     <p>If you don’t have infinite control over your circumstances -- and who does? -- you can end up feeling <br>

  <p>It can feel like you can never get ahead, and never get out from under your stress.</p>
